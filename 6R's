# ☁️ Cloud Migration Strategies

Cloud migration involves moving digital assets—applications, data, and infrastructure—from on-premises environments to cloud platforms. The following are the **six core strategies**, commonly referred to as the **"6 R's of Cloud Migration"**. These methods help align cloud adoption with both technical requirements and business objectives.

---

## 1. Rehost — _"Lift and Shift"_
- **Description:** Move applications to the cloud without modifying architecture or code.
- **Objective:** Rapid migration with minimal changes.
- **Use Case:** Legacy systems needing quick relocation to cloud infrastructure.
- **Example:** Migrating a Java application from an on-prem server to an AWS EC2 instance.

---

## 2. Replatform — _"Lift, Tinker, and Shift"_
- **Description:** Make minor optimizations to leverage cloud capabilities while maintaining the core architecture.
- **Objective:** Improve performance, scalability, or cost-efficiency without full redesign.
- **Use Case:** Applications that benefit from cloud-native services like managed databases.
- **Example:** Moving a database to Amazon RDS or Azure SQL.

---

## 3. Refactor / Re-architect
- **Description:** Redesign the application to fully utilize cloud-native features and services.
- **Objective:** Maximize scalability, agility, and cloud capabilities through modernization.
- **Use Case:** Applications that require elasticity, CI/CD, or microservice-based deployments.
- **Example:** Rewriting a monolith into microservices using Docker, Kubernetes, or serverless architecture.

---

## 4. Repurchase — _"Drop and Shop"_
- **Description:** Replace existing software with a cloud-based SaaS solution.
- **Objective:** Simplify operations and reduce maintenance overhead.
- **Use Case:** Commodity applications like email, CRM, HRM, etc.
- **Example:** Replacing on-prem Exchange Server with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.

---

## 5. Retire
- **Description:** Identify and eliminate obsolete or redundant applications.
- **Objective:** Reduce technical debt and infrastructure costs.
- **Use Case:** Applications that are unused or replaced by other systems.
- **Example:** Decommissioning an outdated internal reporting tool.

---

## 6. Retain — _"Revisit Later"_
- **Description:** Maintain current on-prem deployment for specific workloads temporarily.
- **Objective:** Delay migration for systems with high complexity or compliance issues.
- **Use Case:** Applications requiring further analysis or redesign before moving to cloud.
- **Example:** Retaining mainframe-based financial systems pending rearchitecture.

| Strategy     | Migration Effort | Cost Impact | Cloud Benefit       | Ideal Use Case                          |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Rehost       | Low              | Low         | Minimal             | Fast cloud onboarding                   |
| Replatform   | Medium           | Low-Medium  | Moderate            | Benefit from managed services           |
| Refactor     | High             | High        | Maximum             | Long-term scalability and agility       |
| Repurchase   | Medium           | Varies      | Depends on SaaS     | Replace legacy tools with SaaS          |
| Retire       | None             | Cost-saving | None                | Eliminate obsolete or duplicate systems |
| Retain       | None             | No change   | None                | Delay due to complexity or compliance   |
